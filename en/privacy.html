Scope</h3><p>Transit may contain links to websites, apps, products or services that are operated by third parties (such as Uber). This Privacy Policy does not extend to these third parties on which we have no control and for which we cannot be held liable. We encourage you to read about the privacy policies, procedures and practices of those third parties.</p><h3>4. What information we collect from you</h3><p>We collect and process information from your device in several ways, including:</p><ul><li>Once you have given us your consent to track your location, we keep track of your location and movement, including your latitude, longitude, time and speed of travel.</li><li>The collection of location data only happens while Transit is in the foreground (unless explicitly stated otherwise by Transit) and if you’ve granted Transit access to your device’s location services.</li><li>We collect your preferences, including favorite routes, saved locations, GO stats and other personal customizations such as the “Minimize Walking” option or disabled transit networks, and give you the option to save such information to a Transit account by providing us your name and email address.</li><li>We also automatically collect usage details each time you use Transit, including the country of origin, the searches you make, the routes you interact with, the type of phone or OS you are using, etc.</li><li>We collect your name, phone number, email address and other information you may provide when using the “Send Feedback” feature in the Settings view. When using that option, a “debugging info.txt” file is automatically attached to the email body and contains contextual information (such as your current location, device type, OS version, etc.) that help us address issues you may be reporting.</li><li>We collect contact information (email and/or push notification token) when you explicitly request to be notified when Transit supports a new market.</li><li>When booking or purchasing mobility services directly from Transit (ridehail, bikeshare, carshare, transit tickets) in supported cities, we may collect your name, phone number, zip/postal code, email address, physical address, payment information, and other elements necessary to complete a transaction.</li></ul><h3>5.
